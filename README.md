PIR sensor for ESPHome

This is the PIR sensor built with SuperMini C3 dev board and AI-Thinker's RD-03 24G human presence millimeter-wave sensor.

I'm too lazy to write details, please check below image for welding.

Just to align the sensor with dev board, and make 3v3 connect together, sensor's OT2 pin connected to GPIO1, then connect sensor's GND to GPIO4.

That's all for hardware assembling.

Case STL model also included.
